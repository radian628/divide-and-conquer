# divide-and-conquer
Old puzzle-y RTS game I made in 2019 where you command a swarm of units with the goal of wiping out the enemy. Found in a folder titled "game thigny" in my "Documents" folder. I decided (upon finally uploading it to GitHub) to call it "Divide and Conquer" because that seems to be what most of the game's tactics revolve around.
